    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Catalonia, a Spanish region of 7.5 millions inhabitants, has been on the spotlight in recent months because a significant part of its population is pushing for political independence from Spain. Catalonia has been under Spanish administration for centuries, but its political allegiance has often been under the [shadow of doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Planta_decrees). Even though massive immigration from other Spanish regions during the XXth century seemed to herald cultural convergence towards a common Spanish political culture, the independence issue has reemerged. In this post we are interested in finding sociological variables that are good predictors of independence support, and possibly determine, if any, causality relationships. We will base our discussion on results from recent regional elections published by the [Catalan Government](http://governacio.gencat.cat/ca/pgov_ambits_d_actuacio/pgov_eleccions/pgov_dades_electorals/) as well as on sociological data from [IDESCAT](https://www.idescat.cat/), the Catalan Institute of Statistics."

    "#### Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Electoral data at municipal level could be easily downloaded from the Catalan Government site in CSV format. We focused on data from the regional elections held on the 27th of September 2015, where pro and anti independence blocks, except for one party, were clearly identifiable. A more recent election took place on the 21st of December 2017, with a higher turnout but with very similar percentages in terms of independence support. Ont he other hand, sociological data such as place of birth, level of studies or income level had to be scraped from IDESCAT (the scraping script is available on this GutHub repo). Data was from exactly the same year of the electoral contest. Once both datasets were available, data had to be merged using unique municipality codes. Data was saved in a .csv file hat can be easily imported into a pandas dataframe."

    "The percentage of Spanish-born people outside Catalonia is actually a proxy for the degree of intensity of Spanish cultural origins among the population of the municipality. The variable __'pct_spa'__ measures the immigration level from other Spanish regions, but it does not tell whether this immigration is recent or rather from a few decades ago. However, we know that during the second half of the XXth century there was a massive [immigration wave](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demografia_de_Catalunya) that concentrated in the urban area around Barcelona  ( total population grew from 3.2 milions in 1950 to 5.1 milions in 1970). In more recent decades, the migration pressure from other Spanish regions has decreased. It is therefore likely that  the higher the __'pct_spa'__ value, the more likely it is that even Catalan-born people from the municipality have recent Spanish roots in their family: they are the outspring from the migrants of the 50-70s. That is to say, the percentage of people with Spanish origins is always higher than the value expressed by __'pct_spa'__ because this indicator is high in places were immigration has been high in recent decades. \n",

Therefore, the percentage of people with Catalan roots is always lower than the percentage expressed by __'pct_cat'."
